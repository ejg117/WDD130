        <p>I am going for a software engineering degree to become a software developer later on in a big company as my career path
        <p>Some of my hobbies include Weightlifting, Ropes courses and recreational activities.</p>
        <p>I am taking this course to have better understanding with syntax to hopefully stretch out my knowledge for my career.</p>
        <p>I've been a member of the church my whole life.</p>
        <p>One of my favorite quotes from the book of mormon is "And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise." Luke 6:31</p>
