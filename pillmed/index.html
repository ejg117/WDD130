                    <h3>About Drugs</h3>
                    <p>Drugs have been a part of human culture for centuries, used for medicinal, recreational, and spiritual purposes. They can be classified into various categories based on their effects on the body and mind, such as stimulants, depressants, hallucinogens, and opioids. <strong>Medicinal drugs</strong> are used to treat or prevent diseases and conditions, from antibiotics and antivirals to vaccines and chemotherapy agents. <strong>Recreational drugs</strong> like alcohol, cannabis, and nicotine are consumed for their psychoactive effects and often for social or personal enjoyment.</p>
                    <p>In addition to these categories, <strong>psychoactive drugs</strong> affect the central nervous system and can alter mood, perception, and behavior. <strong>Hallucinogens</strong>, such as LSD and psilocybin, can induce altered sensory perceptions and profound experiences, sometimes used in cultural or religious rituals. <strong>Opioids</strong>, including prescription painkillers and illegal drugs like heroin, are highly effective for pain relief but carry a high risk of addiction and overdose. <strong>Stimulants</strong> like caffeine, cocaine, and methamphetamine increase alertness and energy but can also lead to dependence and severe health problems. <strong>Depressants</strong>, including benzodiazepines and barbiturates, are used to calm the brain and are often prescribed for anxiety and sleep disorders.</p>
                    <p>Understanding the different types of drugs and their purposes can help individuals make informed choices and use them safely and effectively. The history and cultural context of drug use also provide valuable insights into why certain substances are valued or vilified in different societies.</p>
