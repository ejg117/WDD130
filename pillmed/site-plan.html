        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>
            Pharmaceutical drugs are distributed all across the world to aid people every day. However, many of these drugs remain unknown. To effectively spread this information, I work with a company to create easily accessible and navigable websites that explain these drugs to various audiences. Our content covers procedures, reasons for use, and emergency scenarios related to taking drugs, presented in a coherent manner so that nearly anyone can understand.
        </p>

        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>
            The target audience includes patients, healthcare professionals, and caregivers who need reliable information about pharmaceutical drugs.
